- Cut new track into 4 second samples and save path into csv
- Create start and end spectrograms: Names: "ST1 .. STn", "EN1 .. ENn"
- Save spectrograms into two folder: "start", "end"

- Create Tensorflow Datasets from Spectrograms
- Build CNN without dense layers, only save feature vectors for each start and end spectrogram
- Build Distance ANN or Algorithm to compare start and end vectors
- Start and end pairs with min distanc will be put together 
- build original track
